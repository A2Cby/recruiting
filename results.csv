summary: Mobil oyunlara olan ilgimi ve bu ilgi sonucunda kazandığım oyuncu deneyimini oyun sektöründe değerlendirme kararı aldım ve Product Manager olarak çalışmaya başladım.

Startup bir firmada başlangıç yapıyor olmanın sektörel anlamda gelişimim için büyük bir faydası olduğuna inanıyorum. Yazılım ve tasarım ekipleriyle yakın temas çalışarak ekiplerin dinamizmlerini gözlemleme fırsatı buldum. Pazar araştırması ve rakip analizi yaparak yeni geliştirmelerin yapılmasında ve test edilmesinde rol aldım.

Proje yönetim araçları olan Jira, Notion, Trello, Asana gibi bir çok farklı platformu kullandım. Ekibin verimliliğine fayda sağlamak için Scrum Master eğitimi aldım ve çalıştığım kurumdaki geliştirici ekibe  workshoplar gerçekleştirdim.

Masomo firmasında test ekibinde çalışmaya başladıktan sonra testlerin yanı sıra release süreçleri ve firebase gibi araçlar hakkında bilgi sahibi oldum. Testleri yürütürken ürün hakkında bilgi sahibi olmaya başladım ve pozisyon değişikliği gerçekleştirdim. Kariyerime Product Manager olarak devam ediyorum ve development ekibine iş aktarımının yapılmasında görev alıyorum.

Mobil oyun sektörü haberlerini takip ediyorum ve yeni oyunlar oynuyorum. Data driven decision making kavramının oyun sektöründeki yeri ve önemine önem veriyorum. Hedeflerim arasında Nöromarketing kavramınının oyun sektöründeki kullanıldığı alanları daha verimli bir şekilde uygulamak mevcut.

summary: At age 5, I accessed DOS to play Sokoban on the first computer that arrived in my home. By 12, I had learned to code and created a website teaching other women how to build their own sites (it was 2001, and there were still few women webmasters). Now, over 20 years later — with 10 of those dedicated to building and expanding businesses in this space — my passion is still there.

For the past 10 years, I’ve been developing new channels, products, and driving business growth. Even before the term product-led existed, I championed the power of a well-crafted product to drive results. Whether in startups like Wine or large companies like Sephora and Grupo Boticário, my journey has been anchored in three core pillars:

1) Increasingly autonomous, multidisciplinary squads building and evolving products with a focus on scaling the business.
2) Building synergy among CX, UX, Paid Media, CRM, Trade, and Marketing teams, consolidating a data-driven strategy.
3) Smooth, integrated operations that strengthen collaboration between Business, IT, Legal, and Logistics/Supply.

summary: 🚀 I am a trilingual (EN / FR / ES) Senior Product Manager and Strategic Advisor with 10+ years of experience in tech, finance, and sales, working across diverse international markets. My career began in finance, where I developed strong analytical skills that now fuel my ability to align product strategy with business objectives. Moving into the tech sector, I found my passion for building products that solve real-world problems, driving innovation, and leading cross-functional teams through complex product life cycles.

🧠 As a Head of Product at Polemix, my work has spanned user-centric product pivots, over 600+ user interviews, and collaborating with investors and advisors to align our product vision with the broader business strategy. My experience as a Strategic Advisor in health tech, and the 3D creator economy has allowed me to impact companies by scaling growth, leading market expansions, and driving successful funding rounds.

🔥 I thrive on product development, from ideation to launch, and have been instrumental in taking early-stage startups through rapid growth phases, securing $650K+ in pre-seed funding at Kara.ai, and contributing to Y Combinator final rounds. My expertise also extends to advising companies through mergers and international market expansions, such as Wiri’s growth in Argentina, Ecuador, and Mexico.

❤️‍🔥 I’m a product geek at heart. I’m driven by the pursuit of product excellence, enhancing user experiences, and fostering innovation across the board.

summary: I have always been interested in programming and started developing with Pascal in university. After joining Digikala (Iran's leading e-commerce platform) as a back-office developer and growing to become a team leader/Technical product manager, my focus in these 3 years has shifted to e-commerce businesses. 
Gajmarket is an online shop belonging to the biggest publications in Iran ( Gaj International  Publications) and with the help of my team, we merged different sale channels into a Website. In 2 years, we successfully transferred 100% of sales from classic channels to our website while enabling Wholesale/Retail (B2B/B2C) fulfillment ability in our warehouse. I joined iHerb to continue my career on a global scale and face more complexity and details.
I am following software technologies and methodologies and architectures and related titles like Devops but the product and building efficient teams is my passion and looking forward to learning new things to help myself and my coworkers to keep this world exciting.

summary: With a double major degree in Architecture and Urban Design from İzmir Yüksek Teknoloji Enstitüsü, I most recently worked as a Product Manager at Decktopus AI, where I focused on user-centric design and cross-functional leadership. I developed product features based on user research, driving innovation and aligning solutions with customer needs and business goals. Using Agile methodologies, I led sprints, facilitated collaboration, and managed project timelines, ensuring on-time delivery.

I also leveraged my architectural background in wireframing and UI/UX design to create intuitive interfaces. My experience at Decktopus AI honed my skills in data analysis, product roadmap development, and prioritizing features using data-driven insights.

Earlier, at Uncosoft, I bridged the gap between customers and the team, addressing concerns and ensuring product improvements with a “people-first” approach. I thrive in fast-paced environments, with a strong work ethic and a passion for product management and leadership.

summary: With 8+ years of experience in IT and a Master’s Degree with Honors in Software Engineering. I have worked across roles such as UX Designer, Scrum Master, and Project & Product Manager, leading cross-functional teams to develop innovative digital products. My expertise lies in user-centered design, Agile project management, and delivering seamless user experiences across mobile and web platforms. 

In particular, I led the creation of an information system for planning and monitoring the learning process during my bachelor's thesis, applying agile methodologies and gamification principles. In my master’s project,  I focused on developing an intelligent assistant aimed at supporting work-life balance, intelligent day planning, and self-care methods based on scientific approaches in neurophysiology and neurobiology.

I have a proven track record of translating complex user needs into actionable insights, structuring 
product requirements, and driving development from concept to launch. I've conducted UX research, and customer interviews, and built clear roadmaps to ensure that products are aligned with both user needs and business goals. My experience includes designing wireframes, and mockups, creating Customer Journey Maps, PRD, and producing detailed technical documentation.

In addition, I've been responsible for task assignment, progress tracking, and mentoring teams, including developers, designers (3D and motion), and testers, ensuring that each project milestone is met effectively in a SCRUM setting.

I’m passionate about creating impactful, data-driven products that improve user experiences. Currently, I am seeking new opportunities to leverage my product management expertise in a dynamic, growth-driven environment, where I can continue to drive innovation and collaborate with cross-functional teams.

summary: About Me
🙋🏻Hi! I'm Taras (some friends abroad call me Terry) and I would like to share my journey with you, which will give you an idea of the kind of person I am

🚦My roots started from AIESEC, a premier non-profit international organization. Serving as Vice President, I embraced the challenge of communicating effectively and fostering strong teams. This role not only honed my skills in achieving ambitious results but also instilled a profound appreciation for global perspectives and cultural diversity.

📈 Business Acumen and IT Insights under Exceptional Mentorship
My journey took a pivotal turn in IT under the mentorship of Ian Arden, diving into projects like Letzgro, Realomat, Milestonebased. I gained invaluable insights into strategy, sales, business development, and resilience. Ian's guidance was instrumental in teaching me how to navigate challenges, embrace fearlessness, and view mistakes as stepping stones to success.

🎮 Bridging Passion with Profession
My intrinsic passion for games, a constant companion since childhood, naturally led me to the gaming industry with Gameloft. There, I contributed to the success of Minion Rush, a game with over 1 billion downloads. The journey was both rigorous and rewarding, under the mentorship of visionary leaders. This experience deepened my expertise in gaming, live ops, product management, and the critical role of analytics and KPIs in achieving our targets and fostering strong interdepartmental collaboration.

💡 Entrepreneurial Ventures and Software Development

Fueled by an entrepreneurial spirit, I ventured into several initiatives while maintaining my career focus. These explorations culminated in the founding of a software development company, through which I led and supported significant projects across Ukraine, Poland, and Switzerland over three years.

🌟 Focused on the Future of Gaming
Now fully immersed in the gaming industry, I'm seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow. My commitment is to face challenges head-on, utilizing my resources to achieve the best outcomes.

🏃‍♂️ A Personal Note
Beyond work, I enjoy tennis, gym sessions, anime, and gaming. I'm launching a gaming-related blog to share insights and connect with like-minded individuals.

🤝 Let's Connect and Collaborate

I am keen to connect with individuals and professionals who share my passion for gaming and innovation. Whether you're interested in discussing new ideas, exploring opportunities, or simply sharing experiences, please feel free to reach out.

Nice to meet you,

Taras :)

The aim was to create a decision support system that accurately forecasts demand and efficiently plans production. The methods used include Theil's U method, ARIMA and SARIMA models for forecasting accuracy, and a comprehensive mathematical model for production planning that incorporates various constraints and parameters. The project required thorough analysis, literature review, error analysis, and model development to optimize production levels, reduce operational costs, and enhance overall efficiency.

In the implementation phase of our demand forecasting system, we integrated machine learning and deep learning algorithms, specifically RNN and LSTM, to tackle the complexities of time series data and its evolving dynamics. For enhancing our forecast model, we meticulously evaluated various independent variables, subsequently incorporating them into ARIMAX and SARIMAX methods. This approach not only fine-tuned our forecasting accuracy but also allowed us to conduct an in-depth analysis of the models' error rates and regression, leading to more precise and reliable production planning strategies., employmentType=, start_date=2023-09-01 00:00:00, end_date=2024-05-01 00:00:00 | pos: id=658, companyId=9657, companyName=NETAŞ, companyUsername=netastr, companyIndustry=Information Technology & Services, companyStaffCountRange=1001 - 5000, title=Test Engineering Intern, location=Istanbul, Turkey, description=Test Automation and Security Solutions Department

This macro allowed real-time monitoring and ensured process controls during production. At the MAN factory, I had the opportunity to observe and analyze the production and quality testing processes for various types of buses, including city, travel, medium-distance, premium, and double-decker buses.

Additionally, I actively worked to raise UX awareness both internally and externally, contributing to a stronger user-centered culture within the company.

Bonus: During my time at the company, I uncovered an insight through my research that had the potential to transform into a multi-million lira project, influencing the entire organization and product. By connecting user insight with business effect, I developed a strategic proposal that gained C-level support. This insight, which I presented directly to leadership, years later I noticed that various companies began to pursue similar initiatives.

summary: Hello! I'm Mirelly, Brazilian, currently living in Barcelona.

I am a Product Manager with a background in technology, holding a degree in Information Systems and an MBA in Project Management. I have over 5 years of experience working with digital products, in addition to 10 years as a Project Manager in large companies in Brazil.

In recent years, I’ve worked as a Product Manager in the mobile gaming industry, and I am absolutely passionate about what I do. What drives me the most in this challenge is turning ideas into reality by leveraging data analysis, user feedback, and market research. This player-centric approach helps us deeply understand what is fun and meaningful to our users, creating games they love while contributing to a sustainable and healthy business.

Throughout my career, I was also a partner in a digital marketing startup, where I focused on client acquisition, support, and content creation. I had the honor of volunteering in initiatives aimed at young entrepreneurs, including participating in a seminar in China. I also taught Information Technology Management for 2 years at a university. In addition, I took a sabbatical to explore the world, visiting over 20 countries and gaining new perspectives and experiences that enriched both my professional and personal growth.

I am always looking for challenges that allow me to learn, grow, and create products that make a difference.

summary: I am a professional with over six years of experience in Digital Product Management, with expertise in E-commerce, Customer Experience, SaaS, and integrations, working across the entire Product Management lifecycle, from initial Discovery and Ideation stages to post-delivery monitoring. I have experience in defining OKRs, KPIs, and product and performance metrics.

I also have experience leading Product Management and Product Design teams, being responsible for team creation, training Product Managers and Product Designers through individual development plans, and providing personalized coaching.

Among the key projects I was in, I would highlight the following:
- Printi's E-commerce Update (Alpha Next project): a new look for Printi's website, optimized for mobile devices. We achieved an approximately 3% increase in mobile conversion, ensuring at least $300k in monthly revenue. The e-commerce revenue reached an average of $8M.
- Printi 4Business: A corporate SaaS solution for clients needing to centralize and standardize their graphic materials. With approximately 80 clients, we reached a monthly revenue of $500k.
- Decora Printi: An e-commerce focused on B2C sales of Frames and Decorative Screens, mobile-first, single-scroll page. I led the project from product ideation, branding and marketing definition, discovery, and launch. We had an average monthly revenue of $20k. Also featured on one of the biggest TV shows from Brazil.
- Integration with Salesforce: I participated in the integration project of Printi's Sales Cloud and Service Cloud modules, facilitating and aiding in process designs. This resulted in an average monthly revenue of $5M and an average customer service NPS of 62.

I have 12 years of experience in digital environments, working in Agile Development contexts. I have worked in various market sectors, such as editorial, startups, financial markets, consumer goods, and graphic markets, giving me a diverse background of knowledge. I have also worked as a Scrum Master and Quality Analyst.

summary: Every career has its own history. Here’s mine 👇

🎯I became a Product Manager after years of pouring time, energy, and resources into technologies meant to improve the lives of vulnerable people only to realize they weren’t market ready and, therefore, barely available to the people who need them most. Then, I shifted my focus from building for the sake of innovation to building for real-world impact. I became obsessed with creating technology that not only MATTERS to people but also REACHES them. That's when I pivoted from spending (ok, investing) in R&D to the art of generating revenue by making great products that solve real problems, are accessible to those who need them and generate sustainable value for the business creating them. 

🌍Now, I lead product teams around the globe that build technology not for one, but for 29 markets. I’ve stayed true to that early conviction: that only great products are meaningful, accessible and financially viable. With that in mind, I navigate complex, highly technological and heavily regulated industries—like telecom and payments— with the one goal to deliver the best of what technology can offer: its real, tangible and profitable use in people’s lives.

-------------

For the past decade, I've been dedicated to creating and refining products that solve user problems and drive revenue. I follow the HADI principle: Hypothesis, Action, Data, Insights.

- My career started as a Sales Manager, where I excelled using SPIN Selling techniques and focused on understanding customer needs

- In 2014, I shifted to IT as a Project Manager after relevant training. My goal was to boost project success by improving product value and ensuring timely, high-quality deliveries.

- Over time, I realized that my work in sales and project management aligned perfectly with the role of a Product Manager, so here I am today :)

As a committed professional and leader, my goal is to shape a better future by supporting individuals, advancing bold ideas, inspiring diverse perspectives, and continuously growing. My core values are:

🔍 Openness and Trust - I work transparently and welcome feedback. 
🔑 Teamwork - The success of the team is my top priority. 
📊 Data-Driven Decisions - My choices are based on unbiased data.
🙌 Personal Responsibility - Ownership drives my efforts. 
🎯 Goal-Oriented - I am driven by achieving end goals.

I thrive on working with data, formulating hypotheses, testing them, and then crafting effective solutions. I’m passionate about leveraging insights to drive meaningful outcomes and continually improve processes.

summary: 8+ years of product management experience across Mobility, SaaS, Travel, and E-Commerce.

Currently leading the Booking Experience on the Rider App at Bolt. Previously, I led the Pricing Product team at Bolt, the Core Attendance product at PagarBook (SaaS), and launched Amazon’s first-ever Flight Booking product on Amazon India.

I also run Fit Meals, a small restaurant in Tallinn focused on healthy, customizable bowls and wraps. We’ve built a loyal community with a 60% repeat rate and a 4.8/5 average rating.

I enjoy building fast, solving messy real-world problems, and driving sustainable product growth. I’m data-informed, UX-focused, and thrive in cross-functional teams - whether it’s shipping 0→1 products, strategizing roadmaps, or digging into user insights.

Personally and professionally, I'm a big fan of AI. When used right, it can massively boost a product team's productivity, creativity, and speed.

summary: What excites me most about my job is the blend of logic, analysis, and creativity in product management. From generating ideas to implementing them, I thrive on finding solutions that balance user needs and business goals.

In my experience managing mobile applications (brain puzzle games and utilities), I’ve overseen the full product lifecycle, from ideation and strategy development to execution and performance analysis.

My skills include:

- Product Strategy & Roadmapping: building product strategies and aligning roadmaps with business objectives.
- Prioritization: structuring backlogs and making data-informed prioritization decisions to maximize impact.
- Qualitative & Quantitative Research: conducting user interviews, surveys, and data analysis to validate hypotheses and uncover insights.
- Monetization Models: balancing Ads without overly aggressive user impact, optimizing the value and promotion of subscription offers to drive revenue growth, and managing in-app purchases (IAP).
- A/B Testing & Experimentation: designing, running, and analyzing A/B tests to drive product growth.
- Cross-functional collaboration: coordinating with development, marketing, analytics, and design teams to ensure seamless delivery.
- Documentation & Processes: creating documentation for product specifications and ensuring efficient workflows.

I value teams where independence meets collaboration, and ideas are backed by data and thoughtful execution.

About me:
Organized, communicative, and curious. I value clear and open communication, enjoy turning insights into actionable strategies, and believe the best products are born at the intersection of user care, business goals, and creativity.
I'm deeply fascinated by how the human brain works — its strengths and cognitive biases. In my free time, I find inspiration in travel, books, tea ceremonies, and good conversations.

summary: Hey there! I'm Marjori, a Product Manager with a knack for problem-solving and a love for wearing many hats – design, research, and even a bit of coding. I strongly believe in the power of curiosity, taking calculated risks, and not being afraid to make mistakes in pursuit of innovative solutions and valuable lessons.

I've had the pleasure of working with tech companies in various markets, diving into amazing innovation projects. From modernizing a 100-year-old insurance company to blending the offline and online worlds in luxury retail, creating a Banking service experience from scratch, and rapidly experimenting to unlock digital media solutions. I've learned the value of teamwork, building an emphatic work environment, handling stakeholders, staying in sync with customer feedback, and adapting plans to stay relevant and valuable.

Right now, I'm on a mission with Farfetch to help them become the go-to media partner for luxury brands and retailers. In my role, I get to lead product development from start to finish in the Media Monetisation cluster, driving experiments and making a real impact.

1. The customer is the center of everything I do. Knowing your customer and intuition will show many paths. But only experiments and numbers will tell you where the right way is.
2. An organized and inspired team is the key. Only such a team makes dizzying products that cost $ billions.

summary: Hi, my name is David. I'm a tech and product builder who's passionate about making the world a better place through technology.

I've been fortunate to work with some of the most innovative companies in the world—Philip Morris, Rappi, and Zubale. I love tackling hard problems, especially those from Latin America—I'm Colombian myself! I thrive in multicultural environments and diverse environments, having lived in Colombia, France, Mexico and Brazil (I speak english, spanish, french and working hard on my portuguese!).

Building tech-products for +26,000 active Mom & Pop shops in Colombia with Philip Morris, and +100,000 active couriers with Rappi in 9 countries, taught me that anything is possible if you define the right problem, have the right mindset and put tech to it with a team of hustlers! You can guess I’m 100% entrepreneur mindset #GetShitDone #MVP #ThinkBigStartSmallMoveFast. 

I also co-founded  one of the biggest spanish speaking startup communities in Latam which I'm very proud of!  

I'm a visionary builder who loves coaching people on how to get stuff done and I'm also an eternal learner—discipline and focus are my superpowers! 

I firmly believe that technology has the capacity to close social and economic gaps and improve thousands of people's lives. My mission is to make that happen!

​👉Managed fulfillment flows fow Rappi Antojo, Rappi Cash, Rappi Favor, Groceries and Restaurants. 
I'm very proud of building the substitution flows that lead up to 50% of GMV recovered vía substitute products when there was a stockout.

👉I survived COVID times when digital grocery shopping was the ONLY option. Sprinted non-sleep for 3 months and revamped the whole grocery shopping for couriers integrating multi-picking, product re-categorization, isles, customer preferences and many customer enhacing flows that led to an increase in productivity of 1.2x!

summary: Since starting my product management career, I've been passionate about creating solutions that drive growth and delight users. With over 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝟏𝟓 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 as a Senior Product Manager and Product Owner, I've honed my skills in crafting product vision and strategy, focusing on delivering exceptional customer experiences and driving revenue growth.

My approach to product management is like balancing an equilateral triangle on a ball — the points represent the business, technical feasibility, and customer value. This perspective allows me to constantly question whether a solution makes fiscal sense, is technically possible, and delivers real value to the customer. 

I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with cross-functional teams to turn ideas into reality, especially within the B2B SaaS and ML/AI domains.

My journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of UX principles, process improvement, and data analytics, all crucial elements for successful product lifecycle management. 

Being 𝐒𝐀𝐅𝐞® 𝟓 𝐂𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐚 𝐂𝐒𝐏𝐎® has further enriched my ability to lead strategic initiatives that align with business goals and customer needs.

summary: I’m a product manager with a customer-driven mindset and a passion for delivering world-class user experiences. I thrive in product companies that prioritize innovation, data-driven decisions, and user-centric design.

With a background that blends business, design, and technology, I approach product management with a holistic perspective—aligning business goals with user needs to create meaningful impact. Over the past few years, I’ve also had the opportunity to lead and shape product teams, driving collaboration, strategy, and execution to build and scale great products. I’m hands-on, outcome-oriented, and committed to delivering value for both users and companies.

A few things about me:
• I’ve been living in Buenos Aires for over a decade—a proud expat with a global mindset.
• I’m a lifelong learner, constantly exploring new ideas and applying them in my work.
• Understanding user behavior, needs, and pain points is what drives me.
• I thrive in remote and distributed teams, collaborating across time zones to build great products.
• I enjoy sharing knowledge and learning from those around me.

Key areas of focus: Product strategy | User research | Data-driven decision-making | Leading product teams | Collaboration | Global mindset

I’m currently preparing to relocate to Spain as a digital nomad and excited to connect with fellow product professionals and companies to learn more about the product management ecosystem in Europe.

summary: Information Technology Engineer with a Master’s Degree in IT Management and founder of tekis.services, a startup dedicated to enhancing digital skills for personal and professional empowerment. My main focus is on leading teams and developing innovative digital products, applying agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) to deliver effective and scalable tech solutions.

Currently, I work as a Project Manager at the Instituto Potosino de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, where I lead a digital transformation initiative positively impacting over 150,000 users. With a specialization in IT Management, my education at Tecnológico de Monterrey centered on the efficient administration of technological resources.

As a specialist in Project & Product Management, I design and lead bootcamps focused on developing digital skills. I’ve delivered mentorship programs on tech career development, agile management, and leadership—benefiting hundreds of professionals in Mexico and Latin America. Additionally, I actively participate as an international speaker on topics such as Technological Innovation, Digital Entrepreneurship, and Female Leadership in STEM.

My commitment to innovation and education is reflected in my role as a Practitioner at Colectivo23, within the AI Tools & Tech Mindset program, where I share my expertise in artificial intelligence to enrich the learning experience.

I’ve also contributed as a Lead Mentor and Web Programming Instructor for Tecnolochicas, a program backed by Fundación Televisa, promoting digital inclusion and tech education. I teach courses like ""Technical Writing and Code Documentation"" on Platzi and ""Creative Coding: Data Visualization in Python"" at CENTRO, emphasizing the importance of clear and effective communication in tech.

My experience as a tech influencer has led me to collaborate with global companies like IBM, Amazon, and Google. I’ve been recognized as a LinkedIn Top Voice in Technology and Innovation, named one of the 100 Most Inspiring Entrepreneurs in Mexico by ASEM, and selected by CryptoConexión and Mastercard as one of the 50 Women Building Web3 in Latin America. I was also nominated by Women Who Code in the Applaud Her Awards: 100 Technologists to Watch.

summary: Few words about myself: For most of my career, I have worked in the gaming industry, and I have experience working in all departments, starting as a QA and ending as a General Manager for a product responsible for 90% of the company's income. These positions have given me a diverse range of experiences and the ability to understand the challenges that each department faces.

I am not the type of specialist who focuses only on product or production, but rather someone who can wear many hats. I have worked in company with 50 people and one with 1000. I have been a part of scaling processes where I have created multiple departments from scratch, which involves hiring people, training them, and guiding them until they can work independently. A few examples are content, devops, prodops, and several product teams consisting of developers, artists, scrum masters, and dev managers.
 
During my career I had the opportunity to be involved in the company IPO process, helping to prepare the company structure in order to meet market criteria.

My management style focuses on transparency and respect. I like to work with people who can act independently and make their own decisions. I dislike micromanaging (although I understand that sometimes it is necessary to help certain individuals grow). In my experience, when you are honest and transparent with the team, they will understand and respect any changes in the process.

When I am new to a team, I like to observe and learn about the people and processes to understand how I can be of assistance. I do not like to force any changes simply to showcase my presence.

I have experience in developing and managing various digital products, focusing on growth (leveraging business drivers) and digital transformation (Agile as an organizational culture, using Scrum as a framework).

My professional journey has allowed me to consolidate case studies in different industries, especially foodservice and digital banking—from establishing a product department in a foodtech company, structuring workflows and processes to enable sustainable development, to creating a growth case that became a reference for identifying trends in the foodservice sector.

As a product professional, my experience includes…

🔵 Product Vision – I turn insights into solid strategies, balancing innovation, user experience, and business results.

🔵 Growth & Experimentation – Launching is just the beginning. I love testing, measuring, and continuously optimizing.

🔵 User-Centric Thinking – A product without users is just code and a pretty interface. I put users at the center of every decision.

🔵 Squads & Agile Culture – I work to build engaged, autonomous teams focused on delivering value.

🔵 Storytelling & Stakeholder Management – Alignment is key. I make sure to translate complexity into narratives that connect and convince.

🔵 Metrics & Data-Driven Decision Making – ""You manage what you measure."" I don’t make decisions without data, but I also understand that not everything that matters can be measured.

🔵 SaaS – Experience in developing, growing, and monetizing subscription-based products.

🔵 Retail – Deep knowledge of digital solutions for retail, optimizing both customer experience and operations.

🔵 Foodservice – Development of products and platforms for the food industry, driving efficiency and customer experience (through apps, kiosks, autonomous stores, etc.).

And as a human being…

🔵 I believe that great products are built by people and for people (no, I’m not running for any political party).

🔵 I learn and teach in equal measure—good knowledge is shared knowledge.

🔵 I’m passionate about innovation, technology, and AI—but only when they make sense in solving real problems.

🔵 I speak English, Spanish, and I'm currently scratching the surface of French.

summary: I’m a product manager with over 4+ years of experience making Data & AI into solutions that millions of people use at Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and Blackrock. I love building products that aren’t just innovative but also accessible to everyone.

I’m all about making tech more diverse and inclusive. At Microsoft, I co-chair the HOLA ERG for LATAM and have organized mentorship programs and events to support the Hispanic community. Back in college, I led the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) chapter to connect even more students to opportunities in tech. For me, it’s about creating products and communities that help everyone thrive.

I’m excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with AI and building products that not only drive business value but also make a positive impact on the community.

summary: Helping Startups build, grow and scale.
Startup Head of Product, 10yrs Exec at Vodafone. Advised 150+ startups internationally. 

I help startups prioritise what to work on to drive growth. 
In practice, I help SaaS, Tech and Mobile App companies define (1) What products to build, (2) How to build them and (3) How to get adoption.

For the past 15 years, I’ve been helping teams and startups with anything Product. Today I partner with product leaders, startup founders and CEOs and help them scale their product organisations including hiring, product strategy, road mapping, prioritisation, getting to product-market fit and mentoring product teams.

As a Chief Product Officer at Ferry, I had to make a lot of tough decisions, daily. This got exhausting especially when we had multiple good ideas on how to do something but weren’t sure which to choose. The same thing happened during my years at Vodafone, and all the other experiences I had with startups. 

And it’s a recurring theme I see. Decisions take long or feel random, the dev team is disconnected from the founders, it’s difficult to agree on what “great” looks like, there’s frustration from lack of traction…

Does this resonate? 
If so, I’d love to try and help you with defining what product to build, how to build it and how to get adoption.

summary: A background in creative and strategic planning—while working with some of the country’s largest brands—helped develop key skills for the current field of work: technology product development. These include the ability to understand customer pain points, identify opportunities across various areas, assess product potential, and act as a bridge—translating client/market needs to development teams and converting possible/necessary solutions back to clients and markets.

Experience in strategic areas such as digital channels, influence, affiliates, and innovation brought me closer to the iGaming industry, allowing me to work alongside some of the sector’s leading brands in recent years. Passionate about innovation, curious and restless, I’ve been leading high-performing teams since 2010.

summary: Hello, I'm Evandro.

I'm a product leader with over 15 years of business experience and more than 8 years in digital products.

I founded Netzee, a startup I created from scratch, and led it through an incredible journey to its acquisition by Tray/Locaweb, a milestone I am deeply proud of.

I am a professional with diverse experience, having worked on products for various industries, including e-commerce, payments, insurance, and real estate. Throughout my journey, I've discovered that combining pragmatism with a data-driven approach and consistent methods is one of the most effective ways to solve problems.

When I'm not working, you can find me playing Lego with my son, giving talks at public schools, listening to podcasts, or currently reading a book or article about the use of artificial intelligence.

summary: I'm a committed generalist with nearly 20 years of experience in technology. Today, I lead product with a key differentiator: a solid background as an individual contributor. I've been a designer, a developer, and a Product Manager. I enjoy going deep into problems and feel truly driven by delivering real value. Always applying strategic thinking and measuring business impact.

My journey as a Product Manager, and later as a GPM, has been built at Hotmart. I joined when we were 100 people, stayed through the 600 mark, and today we’re over 1600. It’s been like working at multiple companies in one. Each phase with its own context, challenges, and lessons.

I’ve worked across both B2C and B2B2C models, serving longtail and enterprise clients. I’ve led initiatives in acquisition, activation, retention, and churn reversal. I’ve conceived, built, and led product efforts that scaled revenue up to 6x, purely through product interventions. I’ve also shipped ideas that didn’t work out. But I learned a lot from them.

Earlier in my career, I led design and development projects for companies like CNH Industrial, Fiat, Forno de Minas, Itambé, Embaré, and Iveco. That multidisciplinary background still shapes the way I communicate and collaborate today.

I take pride in having built and led diverse teams of Product Managers. I’ve helped develop strong professionals, promoted talent, handled tough conversations (including performance and exit talks) and created space for people to grow. I’ve also led designers and developers, and learned how to navigate stakeholders from deeply technical to highly political.

My focus is on value creation and meaningful differentiation. I’m data- and evidence-driven, with strong product vision and portfolio management experience. I’m comfortable connecting market insight, customer voice, and business outcomes, then translating all that into roadmaps, specifications, and shippable product. I care about clear communication (written, spoken, and active listening) and strongly prefer a good product in production over a perfect one in staging. For me, culture fit and respectful behavior are non-negotiable.

I hold a specialization in Design Management from UEMG (Universidade do Estado de Minas Gerais, 2013) and in Business Management from Fundação Dom Cabral (2024). I communicate well in English and Spanish, and I keep learning, because personal growth, adaptability, and a learning mindset are commitments I carry regardless of the role or context.

I'm especially drawn to companies where product is at the heart of the business.

summary: Hello! My name is Matheus, but you can call me Mat.

I am a Product Marketing specialist with 12 years of experience in technology companies focused on B2B, helping with the development and scalability of products and solutions for various sectors such as Technology, Banking, Finance, Retail and Wholesale, Telecommunications, Industry, etc.

In addition, my experience ranges from startups to large multinationals. For example, I have had the honor of working at the largest technology multinationals in Japan, Italy, Brazil/United States.

Maybe one thing I haven't told you yet is that I've also been a soccer player and it’s through cooking that I awaken the art of creativity within me.

My purpose is to use technology to impact companies and people in a positive and sustainable way. Therefore, this drives me to act in favor of my development to be a versatile professional with a 360-degree business view to help companies with their challenges.

And that's why I love studying, precisely because it’s something I enjoy, but I like to deliver results in everything I commit to. My qualifications include:

- Technical in Business Administration (FIEB);
- Bachelor’s degree in International Relations with a focus on Economics (Federal University of Uberlândia)
- Sandwich degree in Marketing in Portugal (University of Minho);
- Specialist in Marketing with a focus on Growth (USP);
- Master in Product Marketing - Digital and Big Data in Spain (Uneatlantico).

Another point is that I love culture! I've visited 34 countries and this has helped to develop my communication skills in other languages. In addition to Portuguese, I speak English and Spanish, being trilingual.

Oh, I believe you are looking for someone results-oriented, right? Let me show you a summary of my biggest case:

- At the largest IT multinational in Italy, R$12.5MM in revenue was generated in the first year from the construction of a GTM, launch of an API, Data and AI solution, and Sales Enablement. The work continued, generating R$27MM in the second year, increasing the number of POCs from 1 to 5 per month, and reducing the average sales time by 50%.

Well, I think I can introduce you to a bit more about myself in a conversation and see how I can help you. To talk, you can:

summary: Hi there! I'm a Game Designer and Product Manager with a love for creating game worlds and environments that tell a story. With a background in Game Design (I’ve got a Master’s degree to back it up!), I’ve had the chance to dive deep into both the creative and technical sides of game development. I really enjoy working between art and development teams, helping ideas flow smoothly and bringing out the best in each project.

What I’m most passionate about is designing immersive stories, fun game experiences, and unique environments. For me, crafting these worlds isn’t just about the gameplay—it’s about creating experiences that players remember long after they've finished. I’m all in because I truly love what I do.

If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of interactive storytelling, game design, and creating awesome environments, let’s connect!

summary: Tenho mais de 10 anos atuando em tecnologia. Iniciei minha carreira na área técnica (dev) em 2013 e alguns anos depois migrei para área de Product Manager. Comecei como PM gerindo produtos na área de food service (Teknisa), onde liderei o desenvolvimento de um produto de ponto de venda para bares e restaurantes, contemplando processos de venda, pagamento, emissão de nota e conciliação. Nesse desafio liderei também a implementação da versão web das jornadas de backoffice, processos de fiscais e contábeis, o que me proporcionou uma base sólida em produtos voltados para operações complexas e reguladas. 

Ao longo dos últimos anos, evoluí para posições de liderança estratégica em produto, e hoje atuo como Group Product Manager na Blip, onde já liderei múltiplos squads em tribos como Blip Desk, Smart Care e Blip Analytics. Tenho experiência em desambiguar problemas em oportunidades de produto, desdobramento e acompanhamento de OKRs, além de ter um backgroud técnico que me permite lidar facilmente com cenários de desenho de soluções que envolvem APIs e integrações complexas.

Atuei em estratégias de melhoria de experiência, crescimento e descoberta de novas oportunidades de mercado. Experiência com grandes marcas e soluções B2B/B2B2C, sempre buscando impacto real por meio da inovação.

Faço parte do time de produto da Blip, contribuindo para a construção do futuro conversacional e impulsionando soluções com IA e automação. 
Conquistas recentes da área que lidero:
🏆Evolução da satisfação do Blip Desk de 44% para 69% na jornada dos atendentes, em meio a um crescimento de 15% da base de usuários. 
🏆Lançamento do Blip Desk App, disponibilizando jornada de atendimento mobile para +10K atendentes com +70% de satisfação.
🏆Lançamento do Blip Copilot em general availability em 2024, assistente de GenAI que otimiza e gera +15% de eficiência na jornada dos atendentes. 
🏆Lançamento do Blip Calls, novo canal de comunicação para clientes por meio de voz. Em menos de um ano de lançamento, já se tornou case global na Meta. 
🏆Lançamento do Desk Sell, jornada de pagamento integrada ao Blip Desk, gerando aumento de conversão e melhor experiência de compra. 

Por aqui, me orgulho também de ser referência de colaboração e contribuição com times client facing. Tenho uma boa risada e uma super vontade de fazer acontecer! Fique a vontade pra me chamar pra conversar sobre problemas reais, produto, inovação e pessoas!

summary: Currently working in product management and automation space, I am a passionate and an action-oriented individual. My work profile revolves around strategic and quantitative skills while my personal life revolves around creativity of words and time.  

I have been an international chess player in the past securing podium positions for India in World, Commonwealth and Asian chess competitions. I also feel very fortunate to have been the founder of the only organization in India that dealt with assistive technology for autism. I have immensely worked for social causes, including environment, women empowerment, etc. I also model for hobby, despite the glaring scar in my mid-section, and I perform magic to astonish my audience when my words fall short. 
 
I am an avid traveler and have been to 34 countries across continents, almost fully funded, for work, student exchange, internship, conferences, training and chess tournaments. I am fond of learning languages and would love to connect with you in your language :D
