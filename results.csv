Summary: 🙋 I’m a senior Product Manager with background on B2B and B2C in complex and highly technological industries such as Payments and Telco. This is a summary of what I can do: value proposition, positioning, pricing, product management, customer management, channel strategy, lead acquisition and full P&L management. I’m comfortable working in changing and challenging environments. I love contributing as much as I love learning, so I always look for opportunities to maximize both. I’ll try to explain this the Memento way (if you haven’t seen this movie, you really should 😉 )

💳 Currently, I’m digitalizing the B2B payment products for Sodexo in the time of PSD2, the burst of P2P payments and new fintech players. Also, I am renewing the digital ecosystem (ecommerce and user apps) for clients and consumers. I have built client's and consumer's new digital ecosystem including an online ordering portal and a native self service user app increasing NPS in my very first 6 months. Fast learning and a good customer centered approach were key.

📱 In my exciting years in the Consumer BU in Vodafone (B2C), I lived in first person some key changes in the Telco market: the end of Smartphone subsidies, the disruption of fixed-mobile offers, the burst of mobile data usage associated to Smartphones and even the integration of a recent acquired big company as Ono. I had the privilege of launching the first voice unlimited tariffs (Red) which at the end meant turning a lot of conventions upside down. From a product management perspective, I learnt that about everything can change and that, if you don’t adapt to it first, someone will come and make you do it the hard way (not that it doesn't bring some risks, either).

💡 As an Innovation Specialist, I used technology to help vulnerable people. I contributed to the development of a panic button for victims of gender violence along with the Red Cross. A product that, even today, is protecting thousands of women. Also, I acquired project management skills as I became comfortable with multinational and multicultural environments. But above all, I discovered my passion for Marketing, and this passion is what has brought me to where I stand now..

-------------

For the past decade, I've been dedicated to creating and refining products that solve user problems and drive revenue. I follow the HADI principle: Hypothesis, Action, Data, Insights.

- My career started as a Sales Manager, where I excelled using SPIN Selling techniques and focused on understanding customer needs

- In 2014, I shifted to IT as a Project Manager after relevant training. My goal was to boost project success by improving product value and ensuring timely, high-quality deliveries.

- Over time, I realized that my work in sales and project management aligned perfectly with the role of a Product Manager, so here I am today :)

As a committed professional and leader, my goal is to shape a better future by supporting individuals, advancing bold ideas, inspiring diverse perspectives, and continuously growing. My core values are:

🔍 Openness and Trust - I work transparently and welcome feedback.
🔑 Teamwork - The success of the team is my top priority.
📊 Data-Driven Decisions - My choices are based on unbiased data.
🙌 Personal Responsibility - Ownership drives my efforts.
🎯 Goal-Oriented - I am driven by achieving end goals.

I thrive on working with data, formulating hypotheses, testing them, and then crafting effective solutions. I’m passionate about leveraging insights to drive meaningful outcomes and continually improve processes.

Summary: Hi, my name is David. I'm a tech and product builder who's passionate about making the world a better place through technology.

I've been fortunate to work with some of the most innovative companies in the world—Philip Morris, Rappi, and Zubale. I love tackling hard problems, especially those from Latin America—I'm Colombian myself! I thrive in multicultural environments and diverse environments, having lived in Colombia, France, Mexico and Brazil (I speak english, spanish, french and working hard on my portuguese!).

Building tech-products for +26,000 active Mom & Pop shops in Colombia with Philip Morris, and +100,000 active couriers with Rappi in 9 countries, taught me that anything is possible if you define the right problem, have the right mindset and put tech to it with a team of hustlers! You can guess I’m 100% entrepreneur mindset #GetShitDone #MVP #ThinkBigStartSmallMoveFast.

I also co-founded  one of the biggest spanish speaking startup communities in Latam which I'm very proud of!

I'm a visionary builder who loves coaching people on how to get stuff done and I'm also an eternal learner—discipline and focus are my superpowers!

I firmly believe that technology has the capacity to close social and economic gaps and improve thousands of people's lives. My mission is to make that happen!

Connect with me if you love digital as well and want to make an impact through product, community or technology!.

Summary: With 8+ years of experience in IT and a Master’s Degree with Honors in Software Engineering. I have worked across roles such as UX Designer, Scrum Master, and Project & Product Manager, leading cross-functional teams to develop innovative digital products. My expertise lies in user-centered design, Agile project management, and delivering seamless user experiences across mobile and web platforms.

In particular, I led the creation of an information system for planning and monitoring the learning process during my bachelor's thesis, applying agile methodologies and gamification principles. In my master’s project,  I focused on developing an intelligent assistant aimed at supporting work-life balance, intelligent day planning, and self-care methods based on scientific approaches in neurophysiology and neurobiology.

I have a proven track record of translating complex user needs into actionable insights, structuring
product requirements, and driving development from concept to launch. I've conducted UX research, and customer interviews, and built clear roadmaps to ensure that products are aligned with both user needs and business goals. My experience includes designing wireframes, and mockups, creating Customer Journey Maps, PRD, and producing detailed technical documentation.

In addition, I've been responsible for task assignment, progress tracking, and mentoring teams, including developers, designers (3D and motion), and testers, ensuring that each project milestone is met effectively in a SCRUM setting.

I’m passionate about creating impactful, data-driven products that improve user experiences. Currently, I am seeking new opportunities to leverage my product management expertise in a dynamic, growth-driven environment, where I can continue to drive innovation and collaborate with cross-functional teams.

Summary: With over 6 years of experience in digital products at companies like Sodexo, Itaú, wBrain, and We:Digitek, I am driven by understanding the different social interactions that shape our world and enhancing people’s experiences across any platform or journey!

I have experience in developing and managing various digital products, focusing on growth (leveraging business drivers) and digital transformation (Agile as an organizational culture, using Scrum as a framework).

My professional journey has allowed me to consolidate case studies in different industries, especially foodservice and digital banking—from establishing a product department in a foodtech company, structuring workflows and processes to enable sustainable development, to creating a growth case that became a reference for identifying trends in the foodservice sector.

As a product professional, my experience includes…

🔵 Product Vision – I turn insights into solid strategies, balancing innovation, user experience, and business results.

🔵 Growth & Experimentation – Launching is just the beginning. I love testing, measuring, and continuously optimizing.

🔵 User-Centric Thinking – A product without users is just code and a pretty interface. I put users at the center of every decision.

🔵 Squads & Agile Culture – I work to build engaged, autonomous teams focused on delivering value.

🔵 Storytelling & Stakeholder Management – Alignment is key. I make sure to translate complexity into narratives that connect and convince.

🔵 Metrics & Data-Driven Decision Making – ""You manage what you measure."" I don’t make decisions without data, but I also understand that not everything that matters can be measured.

🔵 SaaS – Experience in developing, growing, and monetizing subscription-based products.

🔵 Retail – Deep knowledge of digital solutions for retail, optimizing both customer experience and operations.

🔵 Foodservice – Development of products and platforms for the food industry, driving efficiency and customer experience (through apps, kiosks, autonomous stores, etc.).

And as a human being…

🔵 I believe that great products are built by people and for people (no, I’m not running for any political party).

🔵 I learn and teach in equal measure—good knowledge is shared knowledge.

🔵 I’m passionate about innovation, technology, and AI—but only when they make sense in solving real problems.

🔵 I speak English, Spanish, and I'm currently scratching the surface of French..

Summary: What excites me most about my job is the blend of logic, analysis, and creativity in product management. From generating ideas to implementing them, I thrive on finding solutions that balance user needs and business goals.

My skills include:

- Product Strategy & Roadmapping: building product strategies and aligning roadmaps with business objectives.
- Prioritization: structuring backlogs and making data-informed prioritization decisions to maximize impact.
- Qualitative & Quantitative Research: conducting user interviews, surveys, and data analysis to validate hypotheses and uncover insights.
- Monetization Models: balancing Ads without overly aggressive user impact, optimizing the value and promotion of subscription offers to drive revenue growth, and managing in-app purchases (IAP).

I founded Netzee, a startup I created from scratch, and led it through an incredible journey to its acquisition by Tray/Locaweb, a milestone I am deeply proud of.

I am a professional with diverse experience, having worked on products for various industries, including e-commerce, payments, insurance, and real estate. Throughout my journey, I've discovered that combining pragmatism with a data-driven approach and consistent methods is one of the most effective ways to solve problems.

When I'm not working, you can find me playing Lego with my son, giving talks at public schools, listening to podcasts, or currently reading a book or article about the use of artificial intelligence.

Summary: Helping Startups build, grow and scale.
Startup Head of Product, 10yrs Exec at Vodafone. Advised 150+ startups internationally.

I help startups prioritise what to work on to drive growth.
In practice, I help SaaS, Tech and Mobile App companies define (1) What products to build, (2) How to build them and (3) How to get adoption.

For the past 15 years, I’ve been helping teams and startups with anything Product. Today I partner with product leaders, startup founders and CEOs and help them scale their product organisations including hiring, product strategy, road mapping, prioritisation, getting to product-market fit and mentoring product teams.

As a Chief Product Officer at Ferry, I had to make a lot of tough decisions, daily. This got exhausting especially when we had multiple good ideas on how to do something but weren’t sure which to choose. The same thing happened during my years at Vodafone, and all the other experiences I had with startups.

And it’s a recurring theme I see. Decisions take long or feel random, the dev team is disconnected from the founders, it’s difficult to agree on what “great” looks like, there’s frustration from lack of traction…

Does this resonate?
If so, I’d love to try and help you with defining what product to build, how to build it and how to get adoption.

Always applying strategic thinking and measuring business impact.

My journey as a Product Manager, and later as a GPM, has been built at Hotmart. I joined when we were 100 people, stayed through the 600 mark, and today we’re over 1600. It’s been like working at multiple companies in one. Each phase with its own context, challenges, and lessons.

I’ve worked across both B2C and B2B2C models, serving longtail and enterprise clients. I’ve led initiatives in acquisition, activation, retention, and churn reversal. I’ve conceived, built, and led product efforts that scaled revenue up to 6x, purely through product interventions. I’ve also shipped ideas that didn’t work out. But I learned a lot from them.

Earlier in my career, I led design and development projects for companies like CNH Industrial, Fiat, Forno de Minas, Itambé, Embaré, and Iveco. That multidisciplinary background still shapes the way I communicate and collaborate today.

I take pride in having built and led diverse teams of Product Managers. I’ve helped develop strong professionals, promoted talent, handled tough conversations (including performance and exit talks) and created space for people to grow. I’ve also led designers and developers, and learned how to navigate stakeholders from deeply technical to highly political.

My focus is on value creation and meaningful differentiation. I’m data- and evidence-driven, with strong product vision and portfolio management experience. I’m comfortable connecting market insight, customer voice, and business outcomes, then translating all that into roadmaps, specifications, and shippable product. I care about clear communication (written, spoken, and active listening) and strongly prefer a good product in production over a perfect one in staging. For me, culture fit and respectful behavior are non-negotiable.

I hold a specialization in Design Management from UEMG (Universidade do Estado de Minas Gerais, 2013) and in Business Management from Fundação Dom Cabral (2024). I communicate well in English and Spanish, and I keep learning, because personal growth, adaptability, and a learning mindset are commitments I carry regardless of the role or context.

I'm especially drawn to companies where product is at the heart of the business..

Summary: Hello! My name is Matheus, but you can call me Mat.

I am a Product Marketing specialist with 12 years of experience in technology companies focused on B2B, helping with the development and scalability of products and solutions for various sectors such as Technology, Banking, Finance, Retail and Wholesale, Telecommunications, Industry, etc.

In addition, my experience ranges from startups to large multinationals. For example, I have had the honor of working at the largest technology multinationals in Japan, Italy, Brazil/United States.

Maybe one thing I haven't told you yet is that I've also been a soccer player and it’s through cooking that I awaken the art of creativity within me.

My purpose is to use technology to impact companies and people in a positive and sustainable way. Therefore, this drives me to act in favor of my development to be a versatile professional with a 360-degree business view to help companies with their challenges.

And that's why I love studying, precisely because it’s something I enjoy, but I like to deliver results in everything I commit to. My qualifications include:

- Technical in Business Administration (FIEB);
- Bachelor’s degree in International Relations with a focus on Economics (Federal University of Uberlândia)
- Sandwich degree in Marketing in Portugal (University of Minho);
- Specialist in Marketing with a focus on Growth (USP);
- Master in Product Marketing - Digital and Big Data in Spain (Uneatlantico).

Another point is that I love culture! I've visited 34 countries and this has helped to develop my communication skills in other languages. In addition to Portuguese, I speak English and Spanish, being trilingual.

Oh, I believe you are looking for someone results-oriented, right? Let me show you a summary of my biggest case:

- At the largest IT multinational in Italy, R$12.5MM in revenue was generated in the first year from the construction of a GTM, launch of an API, Data and AI solution, and Sales Enablement. The work continued, generating R$27MM in the second year, increasing the number of POCs from 1 to 5 per month, and reducing the average sales time by 50%.

Well, I think I can introduce you to a bit more about myself in a conversation and see how I can help you. To talk, you can:
